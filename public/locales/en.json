                "*Purity for Darshan*: A devotee seeking a vision (darshan) of Lord Ayyappan must maintain purity of mind and body. This requires observing a 41-day fast (Vratham), typically starting on the first day of the Malayalam month of Vrischikam, around mid-November. A first-time pilgrim to Sabarimala is referred to as a Kanni Ayyappan.",
                "*Spiritual Discipline and Preparation*: The 41-day period of fasting emphasizes the importance of self-discipline and renunciation for those pursuing a deeper spiritual connection with the Divine. Devotees follow strict guidelines during this time to prepare themselves for the sacred journey to Sabarimala and to ascend the pathinettu padikal before entering the temple.",
                "*Seeking Blessings*: Before beginning the 41-day Vratham, the devotee seeks the blessings of both parents and a Guru. An auspicious day is chosen to start, and on the eve of that day, the devotee performs poojas (prayers) to honor the family deity. This ritual includes offering a holy knot tied in yellow cloth containing a symbolic 1.25 currency units, symbolizing the family deity's approval to proceed with the Vratham."

Most start wearing the mala from the first day of Vrishchikam. While any day is appropriate, wearing it on a Saturday or on a day with the asterism Uthram—especially before Vrishchikam—adds auspiciousness. This alignment is revered as it marks the day Dharma Shastha (Lord Ayyappan) is believed to have been born on a Saturday with Uthram in Vrishchikam. Ideally, a Guruswami, an experienced devotee who has journeyed to Sabarimala numerous times, performs the mala-giving ceremony, usually within a temple or sacred place.",

Accompanied by his Guru, he then proceeds to the temple to receive blessings and chants saranams as he formally begins his fast.",
                "*Renunciation and Devotional Activities*: Devotees mirror Lord Ayyappan, embracing renunciation by avoiding social engagements and focusing solely on spiritual practices. This includes prayers, poojas, bhajans, temple visits, and service activities like cleaning temples, helping the needy, and attending spiritual discourses. Abstaining from indulgences, they eat only satvic food, avoiding meat, alcohol, drugs, betel, and smoking. Celibacy is strictly observed.",
                "*Daily Rituals for 41 Days*: Devotees follow a set routine, starting with a pre-dawn bath, applying vibhooti and sandalwood paste, meditating, and singing hymns dedicated to Lord Ayyappan. They refrain from shaving, chant Dharma Shastha's name at least 108 times daily, and practice non-violence both physically and verbally. Fellow devotees are greeted as manifestations of the Lord himself. Devotees go about their fast quietly, without disturbing their household.",
                "*Further Sacrifices and Practices*: Devotees do not apply oil to their hair or body during this period. They keep a tulsi leaf with them to ward off negative influences and temptations. They also abstain from sleeping on a bed and do not wear footwear, enduring the physical challenges as a mark of humility and devotion."
